# AWS File Upload API using Lambda, S3, and API Gateway

This project is a simple AWS-based file upload API built using:

- AWS Lambda (Python)
- Amazon S3 (file storage)
- API Gateway (to expose the Lambda as an HTTP API)
- CloudFormation (infrastructure as code)
- Docker (to simulate or deploy locally if needed)
